in java we have a plus symbol 


+ --- concatination/Appending

if any string is coming first and after that plus symbol is there - next part automatically convert in to String


if user seen anywhere void symbol - that is called a Method

what is class?

class is a combination of Methods , object and Constructor

if any thing is missing we cant execute our pgm

Constructor name and class name should be same

Object ?

Object is a replica of class - or we can say blue print of class

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver() --- Run Time polymorphism

Constructor/MOL/OR /INheritance /Class Object

Inheritance ?

acquiring the properties from other class - that is called a Inheritance 
and we can achieve with the help of extends keyword in java


--- Multilevel inheritance - 


Step by step Inheritance - Generation by generation transformation is called a Multilevel Inheritance


Multiple Inheritance ?

if one class want to inherit more than one class at a time - that is called a Multiple Inheritance

can we achieve multiple inheritance in java ?

No , we cant achieve multiple inheritance at class level but we can achieve at interface level
that part will discuss in interface

What is the major difference in Multiple and Multilevel

What is single Inheritance ? - with the help of extends keyword

Many To one inheritance?

One to Many Inheritance - Multiple Inheritance - Interface level only

Assignment - Currency pgm according to the currency in different Country

IS- A relation 
Has- A Relation in inheritance


Method Over riding :- in Method Over riding we have to create a Same Methods but in different classes and 

Implementation should be different and we can achieve with the help of inheritance

Assignmnet - MNC Company where slary and govt policy will change according to country and logo would be same 

create pgm with method over riding



Method Overloading:-

Same Methods ,in same class but signature/Parameter/Data type - should be different 

we cant use inheritance


Data Type :-

int -- whole number -- medium Range
long -- whole number -- high range
short -- whole number -- lesss than int and higher than byte
byte -- whole number -- very low range

double -- decimal -- high range
float -- decimal -- low range

char -- 'a' 'b'

boolean-- true/false

String - String is not a d ata type - it is a class - "<anything"
but we will use like a data type 

why - that will discuss in String Topic 


Constructor :- 

- Constructor name and class name should be same - Mandatory
- if user is not declaring any constructor - jvm will create Blank or defalut constructor
- if user is delcaring any constructor - jvm never create blank or default constructor

- constructor doesn't have any return type-  Like void
